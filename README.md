# VISN-algorithm-visualiser

- VISN is a dynamic and interactive algorithm visualiser built with modern web technologies, allowing users to visualise, understand, and explore a wide variety of algorithms through animations, step-by-step breakdowns, code snippets, complexity analysis, prerequisites and advantages.

## Key Features 

- **Animated Visualisations**: See algorithms come to life with smooth, real-time animations.
- **User Input**: Customise input to see how algorithms adapt.
- **Step-by-Step Breakdown**: Each step is explained with titles and descriptions as the animation progresses.
- **Code Snippets**: Python implementations of all algorithms for reference and learning.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Understand time and space complexity through clear explanations.
- **Prerequisites & Advantages**: Conditions required (if any) and the advantages are specified.

## Technologies & Architecture
### Technologies Used

- **Vue.js** — reactive UI & data-binding
- **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**

### Architecture Overview

- **Vue Instance**: Manages UI state, navigation, and reactivity.
- **Animation Controller**: Central control system (`animationController.js`) for play/pause/step/reset.
- **Animation Classes**: Each algorithm implements logic via a dedicated class.
- **DOM Rendering**: Elements (like array items and tree nodes) are dynamically drawn and updated.
